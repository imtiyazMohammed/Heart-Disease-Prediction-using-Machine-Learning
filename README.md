# Predicting Heart Disease using Machine Learning
This notebook looks into using various Python-based machine learning and data science libraries in an attempt to build a machine learning model capable of predicting whether or not someone has heart disease based on their medical attributes.

We're going to take the following approach

1. Problem Definition

2. Data

3. Evaluation

4. Features

5. Modelling

6. Experimentation

All the tools and the environment setup that have been used in the project is included in the environment.yml file
